# ExitSounds

Plays a soundboard to others when you disconnect from a call!
Set the exit sound by right clicking a sound.
Note: This uses RestAPI to send the soundboard, meaning you **cannot** hear it yourself. Using the standard soundboard emit event causes it to get cut off anyways.

# Installation
Install with help from the [Vencord Documentation!](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/)
